== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I migrate existing posts to deliver images through Cloudinary? =

Go to WordPress standard media library (select '**Media**' from the left menu). Click '**Upload to Cloudinary**' for each media item you want to migrate to Cloudinary.

The images will be uploaded to Cloudinary while the content of all associated posts and pages will be automatically updated to point to Cloudinary's CDN URLs.

You can perform bulk migration of multiple posts by selecting multiple media items, selecting '**Upload to Cloudinary**' from the '**Bulk Actions**' menu and click '**Apply**'.

Automatic post migration is supported since version 1.1.0 of the plugin.

= How can I update my posts to use local files again? =

In case that you decide to stop using Cloudinary's WordPress plugin, you can migrate your existing posts and pages to embed local image files instead of Cloudinary's cloud-based images.

Go to WordPress standard media library (select '**Media**' from the left menu). Select multiple media items you wish to migrate then select '**Migrate away from Cloudinary**' from the '**Bulk Actions**' menu and click '**Apply**'.

The selected images are automatically downloaded from Cloudinary to your local server. Associated posts are automatically updated to use local image files of Cloudinary's CDN URLs.

Automatic migrate away is supported since version 1.1.0 of the plugin.

We would appreciate it if you could let us know why you decided to stop using Cloudinary for your site.
